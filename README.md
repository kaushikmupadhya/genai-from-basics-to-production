# GenAI: From Basics to Production

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive learning resource to guide you through developing Generative AI (GenAI) solutions. 
Starting from foundational concepts, you'll progress to building scalable architectures for enterprise-level use cases like querying distributed domain knowledge.

Examples of potential applications:  
- IT knowledge management  
- Product specifications for retailers  
- Internal employee portals  

By the end of this journey, you'll have the skills and confidence to create robust Generative AI systems.
